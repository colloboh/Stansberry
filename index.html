    Former hedge fund manager calls this “The Greatest Investing Opportunity of Our Lifetimes”
    <br>
… And it’s already created three new billionaires in 48 hours    
   </h4>


   <p>
       <i>
    Dear Reader, 
       </i> 
    <br>
    <br>
    A huge story is breaking in the financial world and it’s making some people extraordinarily wealthy.
    <br>
    <br>
    Three people have already become billionaires in less than 48 hours. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, marijuana stocks, or penny stocks.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead, a simple type of stock – which millions of investors have not been able to buy for the past 29 years – just started trading on a brand-new stock exchange some are calling the “New Nasdaq.” 
    <br>
    <br>
    I believe literally millions of people could rush to open brokerage accounts to trade on the “New Nasdaq.”
    <br>
    <br>
    That’s because, on it’s very first day, 16 of the 25 stocks listed on this exchange doubled.
    <br>
    <br>
    One stock soared as high as 520% in just a few hours…
    <br>
    <br>
    And the <strong>smallest</strong> gain on this exchange was 84% in a single day.  
    <br>
    <br>
    That’s more than 4x the year to date return of the S&P 500. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Teachers... mechanics... droves of retirees... and millions of folks who’ve never purchased a single stock in their lives will soon rush to buy shares on this new exchange. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I’m calling this “The Greatest Investing Opportunity of Our Lifetime”, but it’s only getting started. 
    <br>
    <br>
    There’s a pipeline of another 100 stocks waiting to list on this exchange.
    <br>
    <br>
    I believe that number could soon jump to 1,000.
    <br>
    <br>
    And I’ve identified the #1 best stock to buy today to take advantage of this opportunity.  
    <br>
    <br>
    You don’t have to open any special accounts or get permission to buy this stock.  It’d take no more than a few minutes to buy in an ordinary brokerage account. 
    <br>

    My name is Dr. Steve Sjuggerud. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I’m a former stock broker, mutual fund vice president, and hedge fund manager.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the last twenty years, I’ve written like this to people off Wall Street showing them how to make money in the stock market. 
    <br>
    <br>
    But just recently I’ve focused all of my attention to spreading the word about the new opportunity I’ve been telling you about… 
    <br>
    <br>
    I've gone to great lengths to get this message in front of you...
    <br>
    <br>

            I filmed a documentary about it, which you can find right now on Amazon Prime.

   <p>
        And I've just returned from traveling over 16,000 miles to share what I believe is the biggest investment story in the world that nobody is telling.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2016 alone, it had more than double the number of IPOs as the NYSE.
        <br>
        <br>
        And the top four biggest companies in the world today are ALL listed on the NASDAQ.
